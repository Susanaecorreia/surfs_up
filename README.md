# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Analysis on weather dataset of temperatures on the island of Oahu to help W. Avy to make a decision whether or not he opens a Surf and Shake Shop. 
The weather will determine if his business survives or not since it is an ice cream and surf shop.


# Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Major Points

   - June and December have similar maximum temperatures, June (85 degrees), and December (83 degrees).
   - June has a minimun temperature of 64 degrees, and December has a minimum of 56 degrees.
   - Overall June is about 4 degrees hotter than December.


# Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

We only have temperatures to make the analysis wether or not the Surf and Shake Shop business proposal would work. Based on temperatures only, we could say the Surf and Shake Shop on the island of Oahu is very likely to be a sucess since the lowest temperature in December is 56 degrees, and the overall year temperature is around 70 degrees.

It is really important to have another query that shows precipitation all year round. It would not be a good idea to have a Surf and Shake Shop in a place that rains a lot.

We also need information on temperatures all year instead of June and December only. And we should have the same data range, for example we only had information until the year 2016 for December, while June we had data until 2017. We have to compare equal data ranges, as well as information for all months.
